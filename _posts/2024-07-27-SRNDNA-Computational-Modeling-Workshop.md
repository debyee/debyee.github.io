# Computational Modeling Workshop

A free, one-day workshop on computational modeling of decision making focused on reinforcement learning and drift diffusion modeling techniques, with application to aging populations. Sponsored by the [Scientific Research Network on Decision Neuroscience & Aging](https://srndna.utdallas.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

Workshop Materials can be found [HERE](https://github.com/debyee/SRNDNA-ModelingWorkshop-2024){:target="_blank"}

Saturday, July 27 \
Before the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference \
University of Pennsylvania
