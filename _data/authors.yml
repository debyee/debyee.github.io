  about: |

    I am a K99 Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of <a href="https://copsy.brown.edu/" target="blank">
    Cognitive and Psychological Sciences]</a> and the <a href="https://carney.brown.edu/" target="blank">
    Carney Institute for Brain Science</a> at Brown University.

    My research investigates the neural and computational mechanisms of motivation, affect, cognitive control,
    and decision-making. I leveraage computational cognitive modeling, fMRI neuroimaging, and pharmacology techniques
    to develop a mechanistic understanding of the neuromodulatory role of serotonin on stress and decision-making,
    with an eye towards translating these neurocomputational frameworks to understand dyregulated motivational and
    affective processes in mental and neurological illness across the lifespan.

    As a computational cognitive neuroscientist, I aim to increase awareness of and contribute to systemic changes
    that will promote inclusive excellence. I am especially passionate about promoting leadership opportunities for
    women and marginalized individuals, and advocate for a diverse generation of future computaitonal neuroscientists.

    In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, hot yoga, distance running, hiking, and camping.
