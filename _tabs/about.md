I am a K99 Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of [Cognitive and Psychological Sciences](https://copsy.brown.edu/) and the [Carney Institute for Brain Science](https://carney.brown.edu/) at Brown University. I study mechanisms of motivation, affect, decision-making in the brain. I adopt computational (cognitive modeling), functional neuroimaging, and pharmacological tools to probe these interactions, and aim to understand how trandiagnostic psychiatric syymptoms relate to dysregulated motivational processes in mental and neurological illness across adulthood.

As a neuroscientist, I aim to increase awareness of and contribute to systemic changes that will increase diversity in STEM. I am passionate about mentoring and developing inclusive programming to engender a diverse generation of future scientists. 

In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing, distance running (I have a 50 states half marathon bucket list!), hiking, and the outdoors. Please to reach out to connect on any of these topics.
