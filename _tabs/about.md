I am a K99 Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Cognitive and Psychological Sciences (CoPsy) and the Carney Institute for Brain Science at Brown University. My research investigates the neural and computational mechanisms of interactions between motivation, affect, cognitive control, and decision-making, with an orientation towards understanding how variability in transdiagnostic psychiatric symptoms (e.g., apathy, amotivation, anxiety) and neurobiological systems (e.g., neural activity, neurotransmitter systems) relate to dysregulated motivational and affective processes in mental and neurological illness across the adult lifespan (e.g., depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, Alzheimerâ€™s).

As a neuroscientist, I aim to increase awareness of and contribute to systemic changes that will increase diversity within academic departments and STEM. I am especially passionate about breaking the glass ceiling in leadership positions for women and marginalized individuals. I advocate for mentoring young students to engender a diverse generation of future scientists. (Psst check out our Growing Up in Aging Neuroscience Series!)

I enjoy rock climbing, distance running, hiking, and camping in my spare time. Feel free to reach out to connect on any of these topics!
